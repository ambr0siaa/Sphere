## Linear Algebra
This projects uses [la](https://github.com/tsoding/la) - Linear Algebra library for vector math. In proporties of [sphere](sphere.c) I'll need more vector stuff and I just add it (see in [la](la.h) function with postfix _dot_ and _norm_).

## The Ball

[ball](ball.c) almost was stolen from [tsoding's ball.c](https://github.com/tsoding/la/blob/master/ball.c) but I implemeted diffrent coordinate system (right handed)

# Quick start

```console
$ make
$ ./sphere
$ ./ball
```
